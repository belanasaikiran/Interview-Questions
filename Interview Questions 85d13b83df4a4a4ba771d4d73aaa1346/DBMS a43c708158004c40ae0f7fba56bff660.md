# DBMS

1. **What is DBMS?**
    
    DBMS is a collection of programs that facilitates users to create and maintain a database. In other words, DBMS provides us an interface or tool for performing different operations such as the creation of a database, inserting data into it, deleting data from it, updating the data, etc.
    
2. **What are the advantages of DBMS?**
Redundancy control
Restriction for unauthorized access
Provides multiple user interfaces
Provides backup and recovery
Enforces integrity constraints
Ensure data consistency
Easy accessibility
Easy data extraction and data processing due to the use of queries

1. **What is DDL (Data Definition Language)?**
    
    Data Definition Language (DDL) is a standard for commands which defines the different structures in a database. Most commonly DDL statements are CREATE, ALTER, and DROP. These commands are used for updating data into the database.
    
2. **What is DML (Data Manipulation Language)?**
    
    DData Manipulation Language (DML) is a language that enables the user to access or manipulate data as organized by the appropriate data model. For example- SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE.
    
3. **Is MongoDB better than other SQL databases? If yes then how?**
    
    MongoDB is better than other SQL databases because it allows a highly flexible and scalable document structure.
    
    **For example:**
    
    - One data document in MongoDB can have five columns and the other one in the same collection can have ten columns.
    - MongoDB database are faster than SQL databases due to efficient indexing and storage techniques.
    
4. **What is CRUD in MongoDB?**
    
    MongoDB supports following CRUD operations:
    
    - Create
    - Read
    - Update
    - Delete
    
5. **What is a primary key?**
    
    A primary key is a field or the combination of fields that uniquely identify each record in the table. It is one of a special kind of unique key. If the column contains a primary key, it cannot be null or empty. A table can have duplicate columns, but it cannot have more than one primary key. It always stores unique values into a column. **For example,** the ROLL Number can be treated as the primary key for a student in the university or college.

    We can define a primary key into a student table as follows:
    
    ```jsx
    CREATE TABLE Student (    
        roll_number INT PRIMARY KEY,    
        name VARCHAR(45),     
    )
    ```
    

1. **What is a foreign key?**
The foreign key is used to link one or more tables together. It is also known as the referencing key. A foreign key is specified as a key that is related to the primary key of another table. It means a foreign key field in one table refers to the primary key field of the other table. It identifies each row of another table uniquely that maintains the referential integrity. The primary key-foreign key relationship is a very crucial relationship as it maintains the ACID properties of the database sometimes. It also prevents actions that would destroy links between the child and parent tables.
    
    We can define a foreign key into a table as follows:
    
    ```jsx
    CONSTRAINT constraint_name]
    FOREIGN KEY [foreign_key_name] (col_name, ...)
    REFERENCES parent_tbl_name (col_name,...)
    ```
