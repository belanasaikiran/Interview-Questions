# NodeJs

1. **What is Node.js?**
Node.js is Server-side scripting which is used to build scalable programs. It is a web application framework built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine. It runs within the Node.js runtime on Mac OS, Windows, and Linux with no changes. This runtime facilitates you to execute a JavaScript code on any machine outside a browser.
2. **What is the purpose of Node.js?**
    
    These are the following purposes of Node.js:
    
    - Real-time web applications
    - Network applications
    - Distributed systems
    - General purpose applications
3. **Explain Node.js web application architecture?**
    
    A web application distinguishes into 4 layers:
    
    - **Client Layer:** The Client layer contains web browsers, mobile browsers or applications which can make an HTTP request to the web server.
    - **Server Layer:** The Server layer contains the Web server which can intercept the request made by clients and pass them the response.
    - **Business Layer:** The business layer contains application server which is utilized by the web server to do required processing. This layer interacts with the data layer via database or some external programs.
    - **Data Layer:** The Data layer contains databases or any source of data.

1. **What is the difference between JavaScript and Node.js?**
    
    
    | Comparison features | JavaScript | Node.js |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Type | JavaScript is a programming language. More precisely, you can say that it is a scripting language used for writing scripts on the website. | Node.js is an interpreter and run time environment for JavaScript. |
    | Utility | JavaScript is used for any client-side activity for a web application. | Node.js is used for accessing or performing any non-blocking operation of any operating system. |
    | Running Engine | The running engine for JavaScript is Spider monkey (Firefox), JavaScript Core (Safari), V8 (Google Chrome), etc. | The running engine for Node.js is V8 (Google Chrome). |
    | Browser compatibility | JavaScript can only be run in browsers. | The Node.js code can be run outside the browser. |
    | Platform dependency | JavaScript is basically used on the client-side and is used in frontend development. | Node.js is mostly used on the server-side and is used in server-side development. |
    | HTML compatibility | JavaScript is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM. | Node.js is not compatible enough to add HTML tags. |
    | Examples | Some examples of the JavaScript frameworks are RamdaJS, TypedJS, etc. | Some examples of the Node.js modules are Lodash, express, etc. We have to import these modules from npm. |
    | Written in | JavaScript is the upgraded version of ECMA script that uses Chrome's V8 engine and is written in C++. | Node.js is written in C, C++, and Javascript. |
2. **Is NodeJs Single Threaded or Multi Threaded ? Why?**
    
    Node.js is a single-threaded application with event looping for async processing. The biggest advantage of doing async processing on a single thread under typical web loads is that you can achieve more performance and scalability than the typical thread-based implementation.
    
    ### **If Node.js is single threaded then how does it handle concurrency?**
    
    The main loop is single-threaded and all async calls are managed by libuv library.
    
    libuv sets up a thread pool to handle concurrency. How many threads will be there in the thread pool depends upon the number of cores but you can override this.

3. **What is an asynchronous API?**
    
    All the API's of Node.js library are asynchronous means non-blocking. A Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The Node.js server moves to the next API after calling it, and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js responds to the server for the previous API call.
    

1. **What is REPL in Node.js?**
    
    REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop. It specifies a computer environment like a window console or Unix/Linux shell where you can enter a command, and the computer responds with an output. It is very useful in writing and debugging the codes. REPL environment incorporates Node.js.
    
    **See the Example:**
    
    1. $ node
    2. > 100 + 200
    3. 300
    4. > 100 + ( 200 * 300 ) - 400
    5. 59700
    6. >

1. **What are the main differences between operational and programmer errors?**
The most crucial difference between operational and programmer errors is that the operational errors are not bugs but problems with the system such as to request timeout or hardware failure. On the other hand, the programmer errors are actual bugs in the application.

1. **How do you create a simple server in Node.js that returns Hello World?**
    
    ```jsx
    var http = require("http");
    http.createServer(function (request, response) {
      response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
      response.end('Hello World\n');
    }).listen(3000);
    ```
    

1. **What is REPL?**
    
    PL in Node.js stands for **R**ead, **E**val, **P**rint, and **L**oop, which further means evaluating code on the go.
    
2. **What is the purpose of module.exports?**
    
    This is used to expose functions of a particular module or file to be used elsewhere in the project. This can be used to encapsulate all similar functions in a file which further improves the project structure.For example, you have a file for all utils functions with util to get solutions in a different programming language of a problem statement.
    
    ```
    const getSolutionInJavaScript = async ({
     problem_id
    }) => {
    ...
    };
    const getSolutionInPython = async ({
     problem_id
    }) => {
    ...
    };
    module.exports = { getSolutionInJavaScript, getSolutionInPython }
    ```
    
    Thus using module.exports we can use these functions in some other file:
    
    ```
    const { getSolutionInJavaScript, getSolutionInPython} = require("./utils")
    ```

    1. **What is Express.js ?**
    designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications and APIs
    
    12. **Is Express.js front-end or backend framework?**
    
    Express.js or Express is a JavaScript backend framework. It is mainly designed to develop complete web applications (single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications) and APIs. Express is the backend component of the **MEAN stack** where **M stands for MongoDB**, which handles database; **E stands for Express,** which handles backend; **A stands for AngularJS**, which is for the front-end, and **N stands for Node**.
