# JavaScript

1. ****What are the different data types present in javascript?****
    1. Primitive types:
        1. String
        2. Number
        3. BigInt
        4. Boolean
        5. Undefined
        6. NUll
    2. Non - primitive types
        1. Object - Used to store collection of data
        2. Array - can store more than one element under a single name

2. **What is DOM? What is the use of document object?**
    
    **DOM** stands for *Document Object Model*. A document object represents the HTML document. It can be used to access and change the content of HTML.
    
    When the browser tries to render a HTML document, it creates an object based on the HTML document called DOM. Using this DOM, we can manipulate or change various elements inside the HTML document.
    
    Example of how HTML code gets converted to DOM

3. **Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.**
Both are comparison operators. The difference between both the operators is that,“==” is used to compare values whereas, “ === “ is used to compare both value and types.
    
    ```jsx
    Example:
    
    var x = 2;
    var y = "2";
    (x == y)  // Returns true since the value of both x and y is the same
    
    (x === y) // Returns false since the typeof x is "number" and typeof y is "string"
    ```
    

1. **Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?**
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is checked during run-time in contrast to statically typed language, where the type of a variable is checked during compile-time.

5.  **Explain Scope and Scope Chain in javascript.**
 Scope in JS, determines the accessibility of variables and functions at various parts in one’s code.

In general terms, the scope will let us know at a given part of code, what are the variables and functions that we can or cannot access.

There are three types of scopes in JS:

1. Global Scope
2. Local or Function Scope
3. Block Scope

**Global Scope**

Variables or functions declared in the global namespace have global scope, which means all the variables and functions having global scope can be accessed from anywhere inside the code.

**Function Scope**

Any variables or functions declared inside a function have local/function scope, which means that all the variables and functions declared inside a function, can be accessed from within the function and not outside of it.

**Block Scope**

Block scope is related to the variables declared using let and const. Variables declared with var do not have block scope.

1. **What are callbacks?**
A callback is a function that will be executed after another function gets executed.
    
    In javascript, functions are treated as first-class citizens, they can be used as an argument of another function, can be returned by another function and can be used as a property of an object.
    
    Functions that are used as an argument to another function are called callback functions.
    
    Example:
    
    function divideByHalf(sum){
    console.log(Math.floor(sum / 2));
    }
    
    function multiplyBy2(sum){
    console.log(sum * 2);
    }
    
    function operationOnSum(num1,num2,operation){
    var sum = num1 + num2;
    operation(sum);
    }
    
    operationOnSum(3, 3, divideByHalf); // Outputs 3
    
    operationOnSum(5, 5, multiplyBy2); // Outputs 20
    
2. **What is recursion in a programming language?**
Recursion is a technique to iterate over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result.
    
    ```jsx
    function add(number) {
      if (number <= 0) {
        return 0;
      } else {
        return number + add(number - 1);
      }
    }
    
    add(3) => 3 + add(2)
              3 + 2 + add(1)
              3 + 2 + 1 + add(0)
              3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 6
    ```
    

1. **What are arrow functions?**
Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript.
    
    They provide us with a new and shorter syntax for declaring functions.
    
    Arrow functions can only be used as a function expression.
    
    ```jsx
    // Traditional Function Expression
    var add = function(a,b){
      return a + b;
    }
    
    // Arrow Function Expression
    var arrowAdd = (a,b) => a + b;
    ```
    
2. **What is async ?**
    
    Async/await **makes your code look synchronous**, and in a way it makes it behave more synchronously. The await keyword blocks execution of all the code that follows it until the promise fulfills, exactly as it would with a synchronous operation
    

10.**What is the use of promises in javascript?**

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in javascript.

Before promises, callbacks were used to handle asynchronous operations. But due to limited functionality of callback, using multiple callbacks to handle asynchronous code can lead to unmanageable code.

Promise object has four states -

- Pending - Initial state of promise. This state represents that the promise has neither been fulfilled nor been rejected, it is in the pending state.
- Fulfilled - This state represents that the promise has been fulfilled, meaning the async operation is completed.
- Rejected - This state represents that the promise has been rejected for some reason, meaning the async operation has failed.
- Settled - This state represents that the promise has been either rejected or fulfilled.

A promise is created using the **Promise** constructor which takes in a callback function with two parameters, **resolve** and **reject** respectively.

**resolve** is a function that will be called, when the async operation has been successfully completed.

**reject** is a function that will be called, when the async operation fails or if some error occurs.

1. **What is the use of a Map object in JavaScript?**
    
    The JavaScript Map object is used to map keys to values. It stores each element as key-value pair. It operates the elements such as search, update and delete on the basis of specified key.
